				Notes

* DONE Tool support for writing JUnit tests
** DONE http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#organize_1
** DONE generic makefile (including unit tests building) - http://www.makelinux.net/make3/make3-CHP-9-SECT-2
** DONE Have proper DRY makefile rules for building and running the unit tests
** DONE ditto - http://comsci.liu.edu/~league/dist/rngzip/trunk/Makefile
** DONE tutorial - http://www.vogella.com/articles/JUnit/article.html
** VVIP I'm making the .class files for the unit tests go in classes/tests/. This means I'm compiling source files and test files separately because AFAIK you can only supply one -d (output dir) during compilation.
** I got hamcrest related NoClassDefFoundError so I added it to the classpath
* Migrate Google elisp code for dealing with Java coding.
* Unit Tests
* Integration Tests
* JDEE
* Bootstrap code
* Have manual and script-based trigger - Get event list from a file
* Transactions (R + W)
** Serializability - Transaction - Read and Write with Lamport TS
*** x on one node, y on another
* Optimistic Concurrency Control - R and W TS with each data item
** without replication
** with replication
