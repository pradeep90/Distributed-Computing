+ The MutexExecutor program allows you to write to a shared file from
  multiple processes with mutual exclusion.

+ To build

  cd src/sockets/
  make clean
  make classes
  cd ../../src/mutexlamport/
  make clean
  make classes
  cd ../../

+ To execute a sample configuration of 3 processes (running on 3
  different ports) writing to a shared file

  cd bin/
  ./run-mutex-program.bash

+ The common file is by default "shared-file.txt". It is passed in as a parameter.
