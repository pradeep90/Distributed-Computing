				Notes

* Java Makefile woes
** TODO When some .class files exist, `make classes` doesn't compile the remaining .java files.
* VVIP To compile everything correctly after making them part of the package called sockets, I had to set classpath as '..' so that it would search for them under ./../sockets instead of ./sockets
