				Notes

* Java Makefile woes
** TODO When some .class files exist, `make classes` doesn't compile the remaining .java files.
* Package
** VVIP To COMPILE everything correctly, I had to set classpath as '..' so that it would search for the ".class" files under ../sockets instead of ./sockets
** VVIP To RUN everything correctly, I had to set classpath AND use the package name of the class
   java -cp .. sockets.Sender
